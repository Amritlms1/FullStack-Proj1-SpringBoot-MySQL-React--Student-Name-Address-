This project is a basic full-stack application where you can add a student's name and address. The application will display these details in the user interface. For the frontend, React is used, while Java serves as the backend programming language. MySQL is used as the database to store student information. Hereâ€™s how the project is structured:

1. **Frontend (React):**
   - React is utilized to build the user interface (UI).
   - Users can input a student's name and address through forms.
   - These details are sent to the backend for storage and retrieval.

2. **Backend (Java + MySQL):**
   - Java is used to develop the backend server.
   - Spring Boot, a popular Java framework, can be used to create RESTful APIs.
   - MySQL database is employed to persistently store student records.
   - Backend endpoints handle requests from the frontend, such as saving new student details and fetching existing ones.

3. **Integration:**
   - React frontend communicates with the Java backend through HTTP requests (typically using JSON for data exchange).
   - When a user adds a new student's details in the UI, React sends a request to the Java backend.
   - The backend processes the request, stores the data in MySQL, and responds with a success message or error status.
   - When the UI needs to display student details, it requests data from the backend, which retrieves it from MySQL and sends it back to React.

This setup allows for a basic yet functional full-stack application where frontend and backend components work together seamlessly to manage and display student information.
